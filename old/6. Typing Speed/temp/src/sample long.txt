In 2088, development for "Sample" had begun, destined to only be, well... a sample of what Synths could eventually become, basically a prototype. He was put to a year of AI testing, which was practically torture, as none of the tests were made for such advanced technology. To make sure he was obedient, he would be given orders and would be evaluated depending on how well these were fulfilled. Sample would be forced to go the repair section of the building, due to many damages mainly caused by testing and the testing staff themselves. After all, the testing staff and the programming staff were not quite the same; the idea of Sample setting a climate of division within the company. After going to the repair section multiple times, he'd one day meet Sapphire, one young teenager, volunteered to repair robots of SAREL's. Sapphire would be the only person Sample would truly vent to, showing his emotional and sentient side before anything. Sapphire reported this to Adam, but Adam denied the possibility that his own employees would have gone against him. A couple weeks later, after thinking and reconsidering, Adam wanted Sample to be scrapped, and wanted another sample to be built, but the staff refused, as it was "needed for Sample to be used at the upcoming convention", for "nothing about Sample had been released or announced yet". It was more of an excused to keep Sample alive when Adam didn't want to.
