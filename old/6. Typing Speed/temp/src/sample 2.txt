Despite the label, the employees in charge of the execution of the project weren't necessarily agreeing with all of Adam's directions, Adam, the director, wanted an "Obedient kind of species that would obey to orders when needed, while guaranteed freedom when not working". The employees ultimately went against Adam's orders, as they only saw another massive failure in how Adam saw things, deciding that an "Obedient kind of robot" already existed, and that an intelligent, fully sentient being would be more of a breakthrough rather than copying what had already been done.
