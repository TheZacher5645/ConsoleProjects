This is a simple example block of text. Just to test how well my software can display it. I'm basing everything off of TypeRacer, because I only know how to copy what I'm used to. Example text that you can hopefully type in the future. It is really mostly dependant on the console for how many words can fit on the screen. So these texts cannot be too big. Or contain new-lines for all I care.
