Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 1 of Jermacraft! The series where I play Minecraft. This is gonna be a singleplayer let's play and when I say let's play I use that term... pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game - you're gonna see lots of fails, you're gonna see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping. So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa. I've got apple cider right here freshly brewed, let me take a sip. *sip* Ah, that's good cider.
